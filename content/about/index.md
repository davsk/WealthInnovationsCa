AN OVERVIEW
Wealth Innovations is an independent financial services and wealth management firm. We are a team of professionals dedicated to developing and providing advanced wealth, retirement, and estate planning solutions for higher net-worth Canadians, business owners and/or professionals.

Our focus is on integrating and coordinating all aspects of your financial planning.

As part of this process, we help you develop and implement your personal and corporate insurance and investment portfolio management strategies that will meet your needs from graduation to retirement. We also help you create greater investment portfolio diversification, therefore, reducing your overall portfolio risk across your registered and non-registered accounts; this ultimately creates greater pension and retirement certainty.
