### As you enter the twilight of your career, or perhaps you have already reached retirement, you reflect on how time has passed so quickly.
---
It seems like only yesterday you began what has turned out to be a very successful career. With a degree of trepidation, you realize that you will now be drawing on your assets for the rest of your life; quite an adjustment after decades of accumulating wealth- you no longer have a paycheck.

What is most important to you is determining how all of your assets are going to be used to build that stable income you need in retirement. Youâ€™ve worked a lifetime to achieve a lifestyle; a lifestyle you want to continue in retirement. Some other important considerations include:

- Ensuring that your income will last a lifetime for both you and your spouse
- Protecting your capital
- Minimizing taxes during your lifetime
- Developing an estate plan which clearly defines how your estate will be distributed
- Implementing planning that will help to maximize the value of your estate for your family

You may want to take our Self-Diagnostic Test, which can provide even further insight into your overall state of planning.

Finally, if you own a business or have a professional practice, a significant part of your retirement planning will also include planning for the transfer or sale of the business. This is discussed in the exit strategy.
